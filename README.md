# Power Platform ALM with GitHub Actions

This repository demonstrates the implementation of an effective ALM process for Microsoft Power Platform projects using GitHub Actions for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery).

## Project Structure

* **.github/workflows:** Contains the YAML files defining the various GitHub Actions workflows for automation (explained in more detail below).
* **Solutions:** Contains the Power Platform solution files (.zip) in both unmanaged and managed forms.
* **Other Resources (Optional):** Additional relevant files like images, documentation, or test scripts.

## Workflows

The repository includes the following GitHub Actions workflows:

* **Solution Export and Import:**
    * Exports solutions from a development environment as unmanaged solutions.
    * Unpacks the solution files. 
    * Commits changes to a designated repository branch.
    * Imports the updated solution into a target environment (e.g., Test, UAT) as a managed solution.
* **Build Artifact Generation:**
    * Creates a production-ready build artifact from the managed solution. 
    * Stores the artifact for release deployment.
* **Release Deployment** 
    * Deploys the build artifact to a production environment.
    * Includes potential manual approval steps for controlled releases.

## Setup

1. **Environments:**  Create the necessary Power Platform development, test/UAT, and production environments.
2. **Azure AD Application Registration:**  Create an Azure AD app registration with permissions to manage Dataverse environments (refer to documentation).
3. **GitHub Secrets:**  Store the following in your repository secrets:
    * `APPLICATION_ID`: App ID of the Azure AD app registration.
    * `CLIENT_SECRET`: Client secret of the Azure AD app registration.
    * `TENANT_ID`: Tenant ID of your Azure AD.
    * `DEV_ENVIRONMENT_URL`: URL of the development environment.
    * `TARGET_ENVIRONMENT_URL`: URL of the target environment(s). 

## Using the Workflows

1. **Modify Workflows:** Adjust workflow files in `.github/workflows` to match your specific environment names, solution names, and deployment processes.
2. **Trigger Workflows:** Workflows can be triggered manually, on code changes, or on a schedule.

* **Microsoft Power Platform ALM documentation:** [https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/power-platform](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/power-platform)

## Additional Considerations

* **Branching Strategy:** Implement an effective branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow) to align with your project and team needs.
* **Testing:** Integrate automated testing for your Power Platform components.
* **Manual Approvals:** Consider adding manual approval steps in workflows for critical deployment stages.

## Disclaimer

This README.md and associated workflows offer a starting point for your Power Platform ALM with GitHub Actions.  You will need to make modifications to suit the structure of your solutions and your desired ALM process.
